<h1>The h&#x113;X&#x14D;guide</h1>

<h2>The Kl&aring; Mk.10</h2>
<p>The Kl&aring; mark two is the very latest and finest in triple cutting edge FOSS hyper-dimensional nasty shape-invader whacking technology. The Kl&aring; is equipped with a Whack-O-Slack Blast Battery which requires exactly five Golden Apples to increase it's firepower.</p>

<h2>Enemies</h2>
<p>These Notyous happen to be invading this shape you claimed, threatening your very existence while at the same time
 feeding your possibly high score.</p>
<h3>Razors</h3>
<p>Mostly harmless in small numbers. Don't fly into them though. Razors move faster and cut deeper when they are damaged. Destroying one is rewarded with 5 points.</p>
<h3>Spires</h3>
<p>These sturdy towers launch player-seeking foo fighters that should be evaded if turning to dust isn't your idea of having a good time. Spires are tough, but can be destroyed. Obliterating one will earn you 10 points.
Their fire rate increases with their aggravation, so be sure to finish them off properly.</p>

<h2>Pickups</h2>
<h3>Apple</h3>
<p>Another way of feeding your score is through collecting them apples. Each provides a whopping bunch of 23 points. Collect five apples in a row to get a weapon upgrade.</p>
<h3>Heart</h3>
<p>Heals 5 HP. Collect five hearts in a row to get a shield upgrade.</p>
<h3>ChaoBall</h3>
<p>Evokes localized Chaos. Sheer luck or skill can haul in quite some points when applied to this spiky blackness.
 When touched, a flash of Chaos turns all close enemies into ChaoMines. These mines can be pushed into busy spots
 or Spires and will instantly destroy the pest. Potentially leaving you with a lot of points and some quiet.</p>
<h3>Multi-X</h3>
<p>Increases your score multiplier by one.</p>
